## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js 16+** - For running the React application
2. **Supabase Account** - For database and API (optional for demo)

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-management-system.git
cd vehicle-management-system

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables (optional)
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials

# Start development server
npm start
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Supabase Setup (Optional)
The app works with a mock fallback, but for full functionality:

1. **Create a Supabase project** at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Run the SQL schema** (see `src/api/supabase.ts` for schema)
3. **Add environment variables** to `.env.local`:
   ```
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

### Testing
```bash
npm test
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## 📊 Sample Data

The app comes pre-loaded with:

### Vehicle Makes:
- BMW
- Mercedes-Benz  
- Audi

- **Sort**: Choose sorting field and direction (ascending/descending)
- **Paginate**: Navigate through results with customizable page sizes

### Create New Model
- Click "Add New Model" button
- Fill in required fields:
  - Model Name (2-50 characters)
  - Abbreviation (1-10 characters)
  - Select a Make
- Form validation provides real-time feedback

### Edit Existing Model
- Click "Edit" on any vehicle model card
- Form pre-populates with existing data
- Same validation rules apply
- Changes are saved immediately

### Delete Model
- Click "Delete" on any vehicle model card
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- Model is removed from the list instantly
